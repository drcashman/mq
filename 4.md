You will be in groups for the following activity (3-4 per group). 

For this activity, you will be managing one of the new local artists (link at the top of iLearn). New artists have been added!

One responsibility of a manager is to develop publicity. This requires: knowledge of the artist, the genre, and the market; leveraging your network; and creativity.

# Part 1: 35 minutes

1. Your artist is about to release new music. With your group, briefly decide what the album (or single, or video) looks and sounds like: its title, cover, subject matter, genre, format, etc. Be creative!

2. Develop a publicity campaign, as part of the release plan for your artist's new release.

Describe how you will create a buzz around your artist and how you will promote their latest work. For a guide, see How to share your release with the world — Gyrostream and Music NSW (PDF) — especially p7, 'Preparing a Release Plan'.

Rules:

- It should be achievable (no sponsorship deals with major brands!)
- It should be realistic (name actual outlets/publications/sites)
- It should be justified (explain why it works for your artist)
- Your campaign must use at least three of the following:
	- Press release
	- Music media (online magazines, genre blogs)
	- General media (newspapers, magazines, online portals)
	- Online platforms (YouTube, Instagram, Soundcloud etc)
	- Online advertising
	- Tastemakers (influencers)
	- Radio (commercial, public, or community)
	- Partnerships/collaborations
	- Physical media, merchandise, or other goods
	- Image/photography
	- Live performance (streamed online or other 'safe' methods)
	- Other (gimmicks, publicity stunts, etc.)

You may consider the following:

- What is your artist's unique identity/brand/selling point?
- Why would these outlets want to cover/endorse your artist? What is the likelihood of rejection/disinterest?
- Would this be financially possible for your artist?

Tips:

- Remember distribution is not publicity. Distribution is putting it online: publicity is getting the world to pay attention.
- Online/social media ads are fine, but remember to clearly explain details e.g. what the ad will consist of, who your target audience is, what the purpose and aim of the ad is, how it provides value for money.
  
# Part 2: 10 minutes 

Groups will be asked to briefly present their publicity campaigns at the end of the tutorial.
